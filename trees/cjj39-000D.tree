\title{Job loss through automation}
\author{cjj39}

\p{
  Historically job losses have occurred when things have been automated, however those have primarily been because the 'effectiveness' of another job has consumed an existing job.
  For example, excel empowered regular people to the point that accountants became largely unnecessary for regular finances.
  MS word empowered regular writers and people, to remove the job of the copy editor.
