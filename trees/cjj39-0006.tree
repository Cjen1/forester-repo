\title{Rummikub is solvable using a normalised form}

\taxon{conjecture}

\p{
  The idea is that there are two normalised forms of any rummikub board which can be simply converted between.

  One which maximises the tiles in the runs, and one which maximises the number of tiles in duplicates.

  The conjecture is that if a tile is placable, it will be directly placable in one of these two normalised forms.
